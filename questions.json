      "Government-led industrialization and the Chaebol system",
      "Tourism development"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Under Park Chung-Hee's leadership, Korea experienced unprecedented economic growth through his government-led industrialization policy and the creation of the Chaebol system.

      "A traditional housing architecture"
    ],
    "correct": 1,

      "Limited international appeal"
    ],

      "A type of housing",
      "The Korean Wave of cultural exports",
      "A political movement"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Hallyu, literally meaning 'The Korean Wave,' refers to the significant increase in the global popularity of Korean culture and entertainment that began in the late 1990s. It emerged during the IMF era as Korea needed to pivot to new exports, leading to the spread of Korean entertainment, including K-pop, K-dramas, and other cultural products internationally."

      "Based on views towards North Korea and Communism",
      "Based on social welfare policies"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Unlike Western countries where the political spectrum is typically based on economic and social policies, Korean politics is primarily divided based on attitudes toward North Korea and Communism. This unique characteristic means that traditional Western concepts of liberal and conservative don't directly apply to Korean politics in the same way."

    "options": [
      "It's too spicy for foreign tastes",
      "The ingredients are too expensive",
      "Lack of historical Korean mass-migration",
      "Poor food preservation techniques"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Korean food has been historically harder to export compared to Chinese food primarily due to the lack of significant Korean mass-migration throughout history. Unlike Chinese culture, which spread through widespread immigration, Korea remained relatively homogeneous and concentrated in the peninsula, limiting the natural spread and adaptation of its cuisine to other cultures."

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The 'Makgeolli Security Act' was a nickname for the National Security Act, which allowed the government to punish 'anti-state entities.' It got this nickname because people would often drink makgeolli (Korean rice wine) after work and criticize the president, which could be considered 'anti-state' activity under this broadly-defined law."

      "Personal taste preference",
      "Religious traditions",
      "Food preservation in warmer climates",
      "Influence from foreign cuisines"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The high salt content in Southern Korean cuisine is primarily due to the need for food preservation in warmer climates. Since food spoils faster in warmer regions, salt was traditionally used as a preservation method by drawing out moisture and creating an environment inhospitable to bacteria, a pattern seen in many southern regions globally."

      "Oil reserves",
      "Human resources"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "After Japanese colonization, South Korea was left with virtually no natural resources - the land was barren, and there were no significant mineral or oil deposits. The only significant resource remaining was human resources, which became crucial to Korea's eventual economic development through their diligence and dedication."

    "explanation": "The IMF Era was characterized by a massive financial crisis and debt. By 1997, Korea's national debt reached 161.8 billion USD, with 60% due within one year. This crisis led to IMF intervention and required significant economic reforms, particularly in the Chaebol system, marking a crucial turning point in Korean economic history."

    "question": "What is a key characteristic of modern Korean housing crisis?",
    "options": [
      "Excess of affordable housing",
      "Too many new constructions",
      "Old apartments with larger spaces being used as investments",
      "Decrease in housing demand"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "A key characteristic of the modern Korean housing crisis is that older apartments, despite their age and potential safety issues, are often used as investments due to their larger floor spaces. Investors buy these properties not to live in them but as investments, expecting compensation when the buildings are eventually demolished and rebuilt, while renting them out to those who can't afford better options."

      "They were created as a product rather than forming naturally",
      "They focused on traditional music",
      "They were older when they debuted"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "HOT was fundamentally different from Seo Taiji and the Boys because they were deliberately created as a product by SM Productions, while Seo Taiji and the Boys formed naturally. HOT represented the beginning of the manufactured K-pop group model, where members were carefully selected and trained, setting the template for future K-pop groups."
