      "Government-led industrialization and the Chaebol system",
      "Tourism development"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Under Park Chung-Hee's leadership, Korea experienced unprecedented economic growth through his government-led industrialization policy and the creation of the Chaebol system.

      "A government housing program",
      "A traditional housing architecture"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The Jeon-Se system is a unique Korean rental arrangement where tenants pay a large lump sum deposit upfront instead of monthly rent. The landlord can invest this deposit during the rental period and earn interest, which serves as their rental income. When the lease ends, the original deposit is returned to the tenant."

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The 3S Policy (Screen, Sports, and Sex) was implemented by President Chun Doo-Whan to keep the population entertained and distracted from his political failings.

      "A type of housing",
      "The Korean Wave of cultural exports",
      "A political movement"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Hallyu, literally meaning 'The Korean Wave,' refers to the significant increase in the global popularity of Korean culture and entertainment that began in the late 1990s. It emerged during the IMF era as Korea needed to pivot to new exports, leading to the spread of Korean entertainment, including K-pop, K-dramas, and other cultural products internationally."

    "question": "How is the Korean political spectrum different from Western countries?",
    "options": [
      "Based on economic policies",
      "Based on religious values",
      "Based on views towards North Korea and Communism",
      "Based on social welfare policies"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Unlike Western countries where the political spectrum is typically based on economic and social policies, Korean politics is primarily divided based on attitudes toward North Korea and Communism.

      "Modern apartments",
      "Concrete houses"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "During the New Village Movement, President Park Chung-Hee actively discouraged the traditional Cho-ga-jib (grass-roofed houses) as he viewed them as symbols of poverty. The government provided funds to help people build 'modern' housing instead, leading to the near-complete disappearance of Cho-ga-jib within two decades."

    "question": "Why is Korean food traditionally harder to export compared to Chinese food?",
    "options": [
      "It's too spicy for foreign tastes",
      "The ingredients are too expensive",
      "Lack of historical Korean mass-migration",
      "Poor food preservation techniques"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Korean food has been historically harder to export compared to Chinese food primarily due to the lack of significant Korean mass-migration throughout history. Unlike Chinese culture, which spread through widespread immigration, Korea remained relatively homogeneous and concentrated in the peninsula, limiting the natural spread and adaptation of its cuisine to other cultures."

      "A nickname for the National Security Act that punished anti-state speech",
      "A law protecting local breweries"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The 'Makgeolli Security Act' was a nickname for the National Security Act, which allowed the government to punish 'anti-state entities.' It got this nickname because people would often drink makgeolli (Korean rice wine) after work and criticize the president, which could be considered 'anti-state' activity under this broadly-defined law."

    "question": "What is the primary reason for the high salt content in traditional Southern Korean cuisine?",
    "options": [
      "Personal taste preference",
      "Religious traditions",
      "Food preservation in warmer climates",
      "Influence from foreign cuisines"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The high salt content in Southern Korean cuisine is primarily due to the need for food preservation in warmer climates. Since food spoils faster in warmer regions, salt was traditionally used as a preservation method by drawing out moisture and creating an environment inhospitable to bacteria, a pattern seen in many southern regions globally."

    "question": "What was the main resource South Korea had after Japanese colonization?",
    "options": [
      "Natural minerals",
      "Agricultural land",
      "Oil reserves",
      "Human resources"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "After Japanese colonization, South Korea was left with virtually no natural resources - the land was barren, and there were no significant mineral or oil deposits. The only significant resource remaining was human resources, which became crucial to Korea's eventual economic development through their diligence and dedication."

      "Massive debt and financial crisis",
      "Increased foreign investment",
      "Agricultural revolution"

    "explanation": "The IMF Era was characterized by a massive financial crisis and debt. By 1997, Korea's national debt reached 161.8 billion USD, with 60% due within one year. This crisis led to IMF intervention and required significant economic reforms, particularly in the Chaebol system, marking a crucial turning point in Korean economic history."

      "Excess of affordable housing",
      "Too many new constructions",
      "Old apartments with larger spaces being used as investments",
      "Decrease in housing demand"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "A key characteristic of the modern Korean housing crisis is that older apartments, despite their age and potential safety issues, are often used as investments due to their larger floor spaces. Investors buy these properties not to live in them but as investments, expecting compensation when the buildings are eventually demolished and rebuilt, while renting them out to those who can't afford better options."

      "They focused on traditional music",
      "They were older when they debuted"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "HOT was fundamentally different from Seo Taiji and the Boys because they were deliberately created as a product by SM Productions, while Seo Taiji and the Boys formed naturally. HOT represented the beginning of the manufactured K-pop group model, where members were carefully selected and trained, setting the template for future K-pop groups."

      "Increased poverty rates",
      "Creation of an educated generation that would oppose his regime",
      "Decreased literacy rates",
      "Economic stagnation"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "While Rhee's mandatory education policy was widely celebrated, it ultimately contributed to his downfall. The first generation of properly educated citizens (Baby Boomers) learned about democratic principles and could make informed decisions, leading them to oppose his dictatorial practices and eventually help remove him from power."

      "They established trade relations despite public opposition",
      "They formed a cultural exchange program"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Despite intense public opposition due to historical colonization grievances, Park Chung-Hee made the pragmatic decision to open trade with Japan. While extremely unpopular initially, this decision ultimately contributed to Korea's economic growth as Japan was the closest viable trading partner, being blocked from China and Russia by North Korea."

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The Gwangju Uprising was significant as it was an unusually well-organized revolt with military-like tactics, partly due to North Korean infiltrators seeing an opportunity. The subsequent massacre by President Chun solidified public hatred against his regime and led to continued civil unrest."

      "It's the only wealthy nation with unusually high unhappiness levels",
      "It shows no correlation between wealth and happiness"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Korea represents a unique anomaly among wealthy nations - it's the only country that is both extremely wealthy and notably unhappy. While most first-world countries show a positive correlation between material wealth and national happiness, Korea breaks this pattern with high economic success but low happiness levels."

      "It triggered unprecedented activism and opposition",
      "It caused diplomatic issues"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Closing universities was a major strategic error as universities were centers of activism and education. Even Park Chung-Hee, who recognized universities as potential threats, never attempted to close them as he understood this would be more dangerous than leaving them open.
